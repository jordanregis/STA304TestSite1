From our study we found that Liberal voters could gain the most satisfaction from increased funding in the education and health care sectors, Conservative voters can benefit the most from solid increases in funding to the health care sector, and NDP voters can gain high amounts of satisfaction with increased funding in any or all of the chosen sectors, with health care appearing most prominent.</description>
